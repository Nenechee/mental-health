## Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-ai-chat.git

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 17 or later**
- **Maven**
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
mvn install

### 3. Configure OpenAI API Key
You need an OpenAI API key to interact with the OpenAI model.

Sign up at OpenAI.

Obtain your API key from the OpenAI API Dashboard.

Add the API key to your application.properties file in the src/main/resources folder:
openai.api.key=your-api-key-here

### 4. Run the Application
Start the Spring Boot application by running the following command:
mvn spring-boot:run

Once the application is running, it will be accessible at:
http://localhost:8080

### 5. Sending Chat Requests
You can send a POST request to the /api/chat endpoint with a simple message in the body to interact with the OpenAI API.

Hereâ€™s an example using curl:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/chat -d "Hello, how are you?" -H "Content-Type: application/json"

The response will be the OpenAI model's reply to your message.
